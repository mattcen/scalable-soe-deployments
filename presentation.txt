What is PrisonPC?
=================

A system designed to allow prisoners limited and monitored access PCs
and the Internet.

For the purposes of this presentation, the only importance of
PrisonPC is that it makes use of a system we call Trimclient.

What is Trimclient?
===================

Basically a network-bootable OS which runs all apps on the local
machine to reduce server load.

How does network booting work?
==============================

#. Desktop starts booting
#. BIOS tries to boot off network card's PXE (Pre-installation
   Execution Environment) ROM
#. PXE ROM requests DHCP
#. DHCP server sends IP, netmask, TFTP server, and TFTP boot file path
   (pxelinux.0, in our case)
#. PXE ROM retrieves and runs boot file
#. pxelinux.0 attempts to retrieve boot config file based on this
   desktop's MAC address, followed by individual parts of its IP
   address (**FIXME**)
   *Remember this*
#. pxelinux.0 uses retrieved config file to possibly display a menu and
   ultimately retrieve a kernel and initial RAM disk via TFTP, which it
   then loads
#. Kernel loads initrd, which then takes over and hands off to
   live-boot.

What does live-boot do?
=======================

**FIXME** Lots of stuff

Trimclient Admin (TCA)
======================

* In-house set of scripts
* Keeps 3 tables:
  * Images (SOEs): A list of SOEs available for booting
  * Realms: A group of PCs. E.g: "classroom 1", "cells", and the SOE
    each group should boot
  * Hosts: Individual desktop PCs, with its MAC, IP/netmask, and realm

    The Emacs major mode is set twice so that if rst.el (a non-standard
    library) isn't installed, Emacs will fall back on text mode instead
    of fundamental mode.
